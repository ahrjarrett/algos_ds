Trees, a review:

N-ary Tree
1. Parent/child relations
2. Each node can have n children
3. Sequential access

Binary Tree
1. Same as n-ary, plus:
2. Each node can have a max of 2 children

Binary Search Tree
1. Same as binary tree above, plus:
2. Each node is comparable
3. Each node's Left subtree < parent value and
4. Right subtree > parent value
