## Data Structures & Algorithms

* Day 1: Recursions & OO
* Day 2: Time Complexity, Sorting
* Day 3: Trees & Searching Algorithms
* Day 4: Hash Tables & Hashing
* Day 5: Advanced Applications & Optimizations

### Exercises:

* Day 1: Implemented Stack & Queue; there are still exercises at the bottom of Queue.js

* Day 2: Quick Sort works; definitely need to review sorting algorithms.

* Day 3: Trees & Linked Lists so far.


# Review:

Time Complexity of Common Operations:

| Notation    | Name         | Operation                                      |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| O(1)        | Constant     | Running a statement                            |
| O(1)        | Constant     | Value look-up on array, obj, var               |
| O(logn)     | Logarithmic  | Loop that cuts problem in half every iteration |
| O(n)        | Linear       | Looping through the values of an subarrays     |
| O(nlogn)    | Linearithmic | Recursion w/ binary split (merge sort)         |
| O(n^2)      | Quadratic    | Double nested loops                            |
| O(n^3)      | Exponential  | Triple nested loops                            |
